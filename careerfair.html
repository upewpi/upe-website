        Each November, Upsilon Pi Epsilon proudly organizes the Honor Society Career Fair, an exclusive gathering of WPI's most academically-distinguished engineering students. This event enables honor society members to network with companies seeking WPI's top talent.

        Our pilot event in 2023 saw successful networking between honor society students and recruiters from 50 prominent engineering companies in the Greater Boston area. Spanning commercial, defense, and medical sectors, the inaugural event included attendees such as Dell, BAE Systems, Leidos, DuPont, and many more. The companies recruit across a variety of STEM majors, including Electrical and Computer Engineering, Robotics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and of course, Computer Science. We hold this event each year to foster meaningful connections and facilitate opportunities for our top engineering students.
